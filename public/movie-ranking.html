<h1>The best movies according to Ragu</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The A-team</h3>
<p>As a action block movie lover this will always be my favourite.<br />
If you are someone who don't care much about realism and logic, you will love this one.</p>
<h3>K.G.F Chapter 2</h3>
<p>One of the best sequel to be ever produced. Of course you need to watch chapter 1 for understanding purposes
    which is also an excellent movie just that it couldn;t be in my Top 3. Action movie and hero buildup at its peak.
</p>
<h3>Kannum Kannum Kollaiyadithaal</h3>
<p>Its a regional movie from my country and of course you can easily watch it with subtitles. 
    Love, friendship and most of all theivery and brilliant and intelligent hero.</p>
